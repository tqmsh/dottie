# Dottie: Your Period Bestie

## Mission
To empower adolescent girls with knowledge about their menstrual health through accessible, friendly AI-powered guidance.

## Vision
A world where young people understand their bodies, recognize menstrual health as a vital sign, and feel confident seeking care when needed.

## What is Dottie?
Dottie is an AI-powered symptom checker designed specifically for adolescent girls and their caregivers to distinguish between normal and abnormal menstruation patterns, delivered through a friendly, approachable digital mascot.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge: Adolescent menstrual health faces three critical barriers:

1. **Knowledge Gap**: Many adolescents and caregivers lack clear understanding of what constitutes normal vs. abnormal menstruation.
2. **Communication Barrier**: Stigma and embarrassment prevent open discussions about menstrual concerns between adolescents, caregivers, and healthcare providers.
3. **Delayed Care**: Without understanding normal parameters, abnormal symptoms often go unreported, leading to delayed diagnosis of underlying conditions like PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders.

### Key Statistics:
- Up to 38% of adolescent girls experience menstrual disorders
- The average delay in diagnosis for endometriosis is 7-10 years, often beginning in adolescence
- 75% of young women report receiving inadequate education about menstrual health
- Only 14% of adolescents consult healthcare providers about menstrual concerns

This problem disproportionately affects underserved communities with limited access to specialized healthcare and comprehensive sexual health education.

## Solution: Meet Dottie

- **Conversation Starters**: Provides scripts to help teens discuss concerns with parents and healthcare providers.

### Unique Approach:
