### API Endpoints

API endpoints cover 3 key functionalities:

1. Testing endpoints (hello and db-status)
2. User Authentication
3. Assessment

| Endpoint                                | Method | Description                                       |

### Data Flow

1. Client gathers assessment data from frontend context
2. Client sends complete assessment data in one request
3. Server processes and stores the assessment
4. Client can retrieve assessment results and history

## Assessment Data Format

The assessment data is sent as a single object containing all answers:

At this point, recommendations are handled on the frontend with `if-else` statements.

```javascript
{
  "userId": "user-id",
  "assessmentData": {
    "age": "15_17",  // Options: "under_12", "12_14", "15_17", "18_24", "over_24"
    "cycleLength": "26_30",  // Options: "less_than_21", "21_25", "26_30", "31_35", "more_than_35", "irregular"
    "periodDuration": "4_5",  // Options: "1_3", "4_5", "6_7", "more_than_7"
    "flowHeaviness": "moderate",  // Options: "light", "moderate", "heavy", "very_heavy"
    "painLevel": "moderate",  // Options: "none", "mild", "moderate", "severe", "debilitating"
    "symptoms": {
      "physical": ["Bloating", "Headaches", "Fatigue"],  // Select all that apply
      "emotional": ["Mood swings", "Irritability", "Anxiety"]  // Select all that apply
    }
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "title": "Track Your Cycle",
        "description": "Keep a record of when your period starts and stops to identify patterns."
      },
      {
        "title": "Pain Management",
        "description": "Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help with cramps."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Database Architecture

### Overview

Dottie uses a dual-database approach that simplifies local development while maintaining production readiness:

- **Development**: SQLite (local file-based database)
- **Production**: Azure SQL Database (cloud-based)

This architecture allows developers to work without setting up an external database server, while ensuring a smooth transition to the cloud for production.

### Data Models

The database includes the following tables:

- **users**: User account information (id, username, email, password_hash, age)
- **period_logs**: Menstrual cycle tracking (id, user_id, start_date, end_date, flow_level)
- **symptoms**: Symptom tracking (id, user_id, date, type, severity, notes)
- **assessments**: Assessment results (id, user_id, date, result_category, recommendations)

### Technology Stack

- **ORM**: Knex.js provides a unified query interface for both SQLite and Azure SQL
- **Migrations**: Database schema defined in `db/migrations/initialSchema.js`
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration in `db/index.js`

### Environment Configuration

The database connection is determined by environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV=development`: Uses SQLite (default)
- `NODE_ENV=production` + `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`: Uses Azure SQL

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dottie.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd dottie/backend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env-layout.txt` to `.env`
   - Update values as needed

5. Initialize the database:

```bash
npm run db:init
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

7. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
npm test -- "UserModel"
```

Run API tests with Playwright:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=api
```

Or manually test using Postman by importing the collection file `Dottie-API.postman_collection.json`.

## For Developers

### Frontend Integration

#### Submitting Assessment Data

```javascript
const submitAssessment = async (assessmentData) => {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/assessment/send", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-access-token"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(assessmentData)
  });
  return await response.json();
};
```

```javascript
const getAssessmentHistory = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/assessment/list", {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-access-token"
    }
  });
  return await response.json();
};
```

#### Getting Assessment Details

const getAssessmentDetails = async (assessmentId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/assessment/${assessmentId}`, {
    headers: {

    }
  });
  return await response.json();
};
```
